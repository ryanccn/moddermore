Big thanks to all of the contributors to those projects who have made this project possible ü§ì

## Development / Contributing

We welcome all contributors to the project! Feel free to open PRs if you see something you can improve üòÅ

Run `yarn install` to install dependencies, and run `yarn dev` to start the development server.

You will need to register for a few services and set a few environment variables (e.g. via `.env.local`) to start contributing.

We use [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as our primary database. We also access the [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/) APIs, and the CurseForge Core API requires an API key which you can apply for [in this form](https://forms.monday.com/forms/dce5ccb7afda9a1c21dab1a1aa1d84eb). Don't worry - this key is meant to be public!

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=""
SUPABASE_SERVER_KEY=""
NEXT_PUBLIC_CURSEFORGE_API_KEY=""
```

There are also a few maintenance scripts available:

- `yarn utils:supabase`: updates the TypeScript database schema from Supabase (change this command if you want your own database's schema)
- `yarn utils:minecraftVersions`: updates available Minecraft versions from Mojang
