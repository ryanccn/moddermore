After a month of tapping away at the keyboard in whatever spare time I had outside of school and related activities, I am proud to announce a major April update! Most notably, we've introduced **a Pro plan** for monetization purposes, which will provide you with some extra nifty features and also help support me in my hobbyist dev work :3

Here is an overview of the features we've brought into production today:

## A new icon!

During the private beta testing phase of this update, I brought up the issue of the site using the stock Vercel icon in the tab bar and a generic gradient everywhere else. [Skye](https://skye.vg/) designed an icon based on the existing gradient with a concise wordmark that both represents the name and the purpose of Moddermore: `M+`.

(As you may have noticed, the new icon has been the profile picture for [the Mastodon account](https://floss.social/@moddermore) for quite a while. So maybe consider following it if you want leaks :p)
